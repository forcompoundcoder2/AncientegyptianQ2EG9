<p><h4>During the Egyptian era, they separated the two genders and made the men’s status higher than the women.</h4>
<h3>The impact caused by this gender issue in past times</h3>
Women had, in theory, the same legal status and rights as men, although social custom and community pressure seem
to have prevented them from exercising them very often.
Women have significantly lower participation in the labor force than men (26% vs 79%) and lower literacy (65% literacy
for women vs 82% of males).
<h3>The impact caused by this gender issue in todays era</h3>
In Ancient Egypt, social dignity was not based on gender, but rather on social status (Jayawardena, 1986; Robins,
1993; Piccione, 2003; Nardo, 2004; Hunt, 2009; Cooney, 2014). This means that women held many important and influential
positions in Ancient Egypt and typically enjoyed many of the legal and economic rights given to the men within their
respective social class.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>They made the men's status higher than the women due to two reasons, one because the Ancient Egyptians think that women are inferior
than the men because the women appears weak because of her feminine side which leads to her caring for the family whilst men appear 
strong and can supply the family, second is because they follow their traditions and beliefs because they believe their beliefs
represent the truth to them and they must appeal their God's


This issue is still relevant today because of tradition or children gain gender roles from their
parents and sociocultural environment which they influence their kids or little once and the society tends to be toxic with
gender roles (in the past and present time) and for them it is normal, it is fine. For example: males should show no emotions
or else they’ll be considered weak, and for females: they aren’t that powerful to speak on their own and are only good at the
kitchen. There is a chance that they might pass that kind of behavior to children which can cause a great impact to the little
ones mindset.</p>
